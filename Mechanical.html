    <p id="red">A lathe machine is a versatile tool used for shaping materials like metal, wood, or plastic. It operates by
      rotating the workpiece against a cutting tool, which can be adjusted for various angles and depths. The
      primary functions include turning, drilling, and threading, making it crucial in manufacturing and
      woodworking. Lathe machines come in different types, such as engine lathes, turret lathes, and CNC lathes,
      each offering specific features for precision and automation. Essential for producing cylindrical parts,
      they are fundamental in both industrial and hobbyist settings, enabling detailed and accurateÂ craftsmanship.</p>
