        <h1>Lathe Machine Animation</h1>
        
        <video width="600" src="late3.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>A lathe machine is a versatile tool used for shaping materials like metal, wood, or plastic. It operates by
            rotating the workpiece against a cutting tool, which can be adjusted for various angles and depths. The
            primary functions include turning, drilling, and threading, making it crucial in manufacturing and
            woodworking. Lathe machines come in different types, such as engine lathes, turret lathes, and CNC lathes,
            each offering specific features for precision and automation. Essential for producing cylindrical parts,
            they are fundamental in both industrial and hobbyist settings, enabling detailed and accurate craftsmanship.

        <h2>Parts of Lathe Machine</h2>
        <h3>Headstock</h3>
        <video width="400" src="headstock.mp4" controls loop autoplay></video>
        <p> The headstock on a lathe is a critical component that houses the main spindle, motor, and gear mechanisms.
            It rotates the workpiece and provides the necessary power and precision for various cutting, drilling, and
            shaping operations</p>
        <h3>Tailstock</h3>
        <video width="400 " src="tailstock.mp4" controls loop autoplay ></video>
        <p>The tailstock on a lathe supports the non-driven end of the workpiece, stabilizing it during machining. It
            can be adjusted and holds tools like live centers or  drill chucks.</p>
        <h3>3 Jaw chuck</h3>
        <video width="400" src="3jaw chuck.mp4" controls loop autoplay></video>
        <p>A 3-jaw chuck in a lathe machine is a workholding device with three jaws that automatically center and
            securely grip cylindrical workpieces for accurate and consistent machining operations.</p>
        <h3>4 Jaw chuck</h3>
        <video width="400" src="4jaw chuck.mp4" controls loop autoplay ></video>
        <p>A 4-jaw chuck in a lathe machine has four independently adjustable jaws, allowing for the precise centering
            and clamping of irregularly shaped or non-cylindrical workpieces. It offers greater versatility and accuracy
            compared to a 3-jaw chuck.</p>
        <h3>Spindle</h3>
        <video width="400" src="spindal.mp4" controls loop autoplay ></video>
        <p>The spindle in a lathe machine is a rotating axis that holds and drives the workpiece. It is typically
            located in the headstock, ensuring precision and stability during machining processes like turning,
            facing, or threading.</p>
